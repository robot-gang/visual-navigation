# How to develop this code?

## Setting things up

- Install miniconda/anaconda on your system
- Run the following command to set up the environment
    + `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- The environment's name is `visual_nav`
- To activate the environment: `conda activate visual_nav`
- To deactivate: `conda deactivate`

### Update environment.yml

If you want to install new packages for your code, you should follow the
following steps.

- Make sure your `~/.condarc` (conda configuration file, it is in your
  home folder) has these lines:

```.condarc
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
channel_priority: strict
```

- Pull the latest code from the repository: `git pull`
    + If there are conflicts, you should resolve them all before doing
    the next step.
- Install the new package
    + e.g., `conda install numpy`
- Update the environment.yml
    + `conda env export --from-history > environment.yml`
- Add and commit the change to master

## Coding

- Branches
    + master: the master branch
    + gh-pages: the website
- CODE, COMMIT, AND PUSH TO MASTER
    + CREATE A NEW FOLDER FOR YOUR CODE
    + Put an empty `__init__.py` in every folder that you created to
    make it as a Python module. We can import and use these folders as
    normal Python modules/packages.
