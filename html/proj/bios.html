Son Tran, a senior EECS student who is graduating in Fall 2020. He is
interested in robotics, computer vision and machine learning. He worked
mainly for moving object detection algorithm design, and implemented the
algorithm together with Zuyong Li. He also took care all things related
to setting up the environments for coding and making this website.

Zuyong Li, a senior EECS student who is graduating in Spring 2020. He is interested
in robotics, computer vision and machine learning. He worked mainly for moving object
detection algorithm design, and implemented the algorithm together with Son Tran. He
also collected the data for moving object detection using a ROAR car.

Shawn Shacterman, a senior EECS student who is graduating in Fall 2020. He is interested
robotics, machine learning, and drinking alone. He worked on extending the rendering engine
for the HumANav dataset to allow for multiple humans in the environment. He also worked a
little on generating basic trajectories for human obstacles.

Yuanrong Han, usually he goes by Rex. He is a senior EECS student who is
graduating in Fall 2020.  He is interested in robotics, machine
learning, and cooking. He worked with Shawn on extending the rendering
engine from HumANav dataset, and he also helped to write a class to
generate a sequence of images in different trajectories.
