  In this paper we extend recently proposed solutions for tackling autonomous
  navigation in unknown environments, and demonstrate a method for identifying
  dynamic obstacles only using information from an RGB-D camera. We also extend
  current state-of-the-art methods for quickly generating simulated scenarios in
  which a robot must navigate to a goal while avoiding moving obstacles. Finally,
  we propose an approach for combining the identification of dynamic obstacles
  with these random scenarios to train a network to accurately predict waypoints
   on the path from a start position to a goal position in unknown environments.
