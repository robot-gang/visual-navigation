<!-- Abstract -->
<hr>
<center><h1>Overview</h1></center>
<br>
<body>
  We extend recently proposed solutions for tackling autonomous
  navigation in unknown environments, and demonstrate a method for identifying
  dynamic obstacles only using information from an RGB-D camera.
  we successfully extended the HumANav dataset to allow for a wider
  range of scenarios that can be used to train our perception module. We designed
  an algorithm that successfully and accurately detects the moving objects by
  combining changes in intensity and depth.

  The result of data generation and moving object detection look appealing and
  encouraging. The end goal is to design and train a neural network for waypoint
  detection and integrating all modules of our design and applying to hardwares.
  This would solve the autonomous navigation in dynamic unknown environments with
  low cost sensors. Especially, it would work for indoor robots which operate
  at a low speed and the environments are most likely to be dynamic. Warehouse robots
  would benefit the most.

     We decide to use HumANav to generate synthetic human and environment to make
     data generation easier. So HumANav Dataset. It combines SURREAL engine and
     Swiftshader engine using SD3DIS building data. SURREAL generates synthetic
     but realistic images of people, and it also provides RGB data and disparity.
     HumANav uses the Stanford Large Scale 3d Indoor Spaces Dataset, since the mesh
     in the dataset is independent from the rendering engine, HumANav combines the
     SURREAL human mesh with the S3DIS to generate a synthetic human image in an
     indoor environment.

  <h3> Data Generation</h3>
  <p>
    For generating data, we use HumANav to generate photorealistic synthetic indoor
    moving human images. HumANav combines SURREAL engine and Swiftshader engine using
    SD3DISbuilding data . SURREAL generates synthetic but realisticimages of
    people, and it also provides RGB data and disparity. HumANav uses the Stanford
    Large Scale 3D Indoor SpacesDataset, since the mesh in the dataset is
    independent fromthe rendering engine, HumANav combines the SURREAL human mesh
    with the S3DIS to generate a synthetic humanimage in an indoor environment.
    HumANav Dataset contains6000 different human meshes with different poses,
    genders,body shapes, lighting conditions and velocities.HumANavWe have written
    a trajectory class to generating a sequence of images that human moving in a
    straight line or turning (circle trajectory) at a constant velocity. We also
    write code to random generate human in the environment, and also we add support
    for multiple human in a scene where HumANav does not support. In the figure
    above, left is a RGB image, in the middle is a disparity map and on the right
    is the top down view, and all three images are generated automatically.

  <br>
  We also write code to random generate human in the environment, and also we
  add support for multiple human in a scene where HumANav does not support. We
  make the area around each human darker to indicate more strictive feasible area
  for the robot.

  <h3> Motion Detection</h3>
  <p>
    The input gray-scale images and depth arrays are obtained from an Intel
    RealSense depth camera D435i, which is mounted on a robot car (designed by
    the Robot Open Autonomous Racing team) about $10cm$ above the ground.

  The camera pose has changed by inspecting
  the tiles on the ground. The bottom intersection of tile lines in B is
  closer to the image border. The person is walking by inspecting the change
  of his pose. In the left image, his left hand is shown; whereas his left
  hand is covered in the right image.

    Motion detection result: (a), the changes in intensity. It also
    captures the intensity change of the floor which is caused by the change of
    camera pose (b), the changes in depth Delta Lambda. The depth is
    sensitive to the setting of environment. The change of depth captures
    the border of the walking person and a lot of random stuff from the
    background. (c), combination of change in intensity and depth produces a
    better and clean detection, where intensity and depth are weighted equally.

<!-- Conclusion -->

<center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>
<br>
In this project, we successfully extended the HumANav dataset to allow for a wider
range of scenarios that can be used to train our perception module. Rather than having
our obstacles take an optimal trajectory, our dataset allows us to set arbitrary
trajectories along the free space of the occupancy map. Our approach of combining changes
in intensity and depth successfully detects the moving objects. Changes in intensity
captures both the motion of object and camera. Changes in depth captures the border of
the moving objects. Linear combination of intensity and depth produces a cleaner
detection better than either of them.

The main chanllege of detecting moving objects is how to compare two RGB/grayscale
images or depth arrays. The first task is to make sure that those two input intenseity
are viewed in the same projection plane, and the two input depth array are seen from the
same camera pose. It was solved by using perspective warping and reprojection. It took a long
time to find out that Gaussian filter and normalization before comparison are crucial. 

More work needs to be done in determining a good method for sampling different
obstacle trajectories that the vehicle is likely to encounter in the real world.
his will be essential in generating a good dataset that our perception module can learn
and generalize from. We also need to experiment with different neural networks in the
perception module. At the moment, we are unsure whether a normal CNN, a CNN-LSTM,
or something different like a temporal CNN will generalize well in this task
(and ideally perform well in real-time).
