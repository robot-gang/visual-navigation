        We thank Professor Shankar Sastry and the course staff for assistance with the project
        idea for the problem. We thank the Robot Open Autonomous Racing team for providing us a
        robot car and calibrating the RealSense camera. We also thank Nghia Ho for sharing the code
        how to compute the rigid body transformation for given 3D correspondence points.
