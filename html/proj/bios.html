Shawn Shacterman, a senior EECS student who is graduating in Fall 2020. He is interested
robotics, machine learning, and drinking alone. He worked on extending the rendering engine
for the HumANav dataset to allow for multiple humans in the environment. He also worked a
little on generating basic trajectories for human obstacles.
